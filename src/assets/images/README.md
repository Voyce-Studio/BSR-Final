# Image Asset Map

Drop final artwork into the folders below so components know where to look:

- `artists/profiles/` — square artist portraits used across roster pages.
- `artists/press/` — landscape press shots for hero sections, interviews, etc.
- `releases/covers/` — album and single artwork.
- `placeholders/` — temporary textures (e.g., gradient JPGs) referenced by `ImageSurface` until final art lands.

Keep filenames kebab-cased (e.g., `miss-bliss-profile.webp`). Update the relevant constants/components once artwork is in place.
